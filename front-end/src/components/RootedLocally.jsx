            Inspired by models like Street Medicine Ireland and other global street
            medicine programs, our team initiated a similar approach in Kenya.
            In 2024, we organized a landmark symposium in Nairobi, connecting Irish
            and Kenyan practitioners and policymakers. We are deepening that
            bridgeâ€”in the field we are offering technical expertise and advocacy.
            We are not outsiders parachuting in; we are connectors and co-creators
            of solutions rooted in local realities grounded by 3 pillars: prevention,
            treatment, and support of marginalized and vulnerable populations
            affected by alcohol and drug addiction.
